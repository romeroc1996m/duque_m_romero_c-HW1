# Duque_Romero-HW1_AJAXREDUX

This is a team work based on the Star Wars API where a dynamic and responsive website was created featuring iconic characters like Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Biggs Darklighter, and more. Users can access movie information associated with these characters by simply clicking on any of them, accessing to the API with an Ajax Call and populating with images of different characters. In the midtime some GreenSock enhancements are used to add engament to this website.
